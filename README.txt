Hello! Thanks for grading our project. Just a few quick notes that will help you smooth along the process.

1) In the FileUtils.java file, on lines 15 and 16, the file path for the "user.txt" file that is included here;
obviously this one you probably knew beforehand

2) We did successfully complete the extra credit portion

Once again, thank you for grading our project! I think we've made it as easy as possible for you.

Happy Holidays!
